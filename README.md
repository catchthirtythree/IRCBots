# Tw(itch)IRC

This project is meant to refamiliarize myself with different programming languages by making a simple bot for Twitch IRC as well as be a nice start for others who wish to create their own IRC bots.
I will be doing this in a step-by-step process so that no language falls behind. 
I will only make use of libraries if it is absolutely necessary to continue.
I will try to use as little OO programming as possible until I feel it is necessary.

We'll be referring to this a lot: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md

##### Languages:
