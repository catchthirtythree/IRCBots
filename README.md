# Tw(itch)IRC

This repository is meant to refamiliarize myself with different programming languages by making a simple bot for Twitch IRC. I will be doing this in a step-by-step process so that no language falls behind. I will only make use of libraries if it is absolutely necessary to continue.

##### Languages:
- Java
- CSharp
- Python
- functional language here
- other languages here

##### Steps:

1. Connect to irc.twitch.tv:6667, authenticate, join a channel and display incoming messages.
